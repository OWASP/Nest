# OWASP Nest

## Initial Setup

Follow these steps to set up the OWASP Nest application:

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Fork <https://github.com/OWASP/Nest> repository using "Fork" button

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository code from your GitHub account using the following command:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/<nest-fork>
     ```

1. **Create Environment Files**:
   - Create a local environment file in the `backend` directory:

     ```bash
     touch backend/.env/local
     ```

   - Copy the contents from the template file into your new local environment file:

     ```bash
     cat backend/.env/template > backend/.env/local
     ```

   - Create a local environment file in the `frontend` directory:

     ```bash
     touch frontend/.env
     ```

   - Copy the contents from the template file into your new local environment file:

     ```bash
     cat frontend/.env.example > frontend/.env
     ```

1. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Open the `backend/.env/local` file in your preferred text editor and change the `DJANGO_CONFIGURATION` value to `Local`:

     ```plaintext
     DJANGO_CONFIGURATION=Local
     ```

1. **Set Up Algolia**:
   - Go to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) and create a free account.
   - After creating an account, create an Algolia app.
   - Update your `.env/local` file with the following keys from your Algolia app:

   ```plaintext
   DJANGO_ALGOLIA_API_KEY=<your_algolia_api_key>
   DJANGO_ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=<your_algolia_application_id>
   ```

   - Ensure that your API key has index write permissions. You can ignore any onboarding wizard instructions provided by Algolia.

1. **Run the Application**:
   - In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

   - Leave this terminal session running and wait until you see that [Nest local](http://localhost:8000/api/v1) is responding.

1. **Load Initial Data**:
   - Open a new terminal session and run the following command to populate the database with initial data from fixtures:

   ```bash
   make load-data
   ```

1. **Index Data**:
   - In the same terminal session, run the following command to index the data:

   ```bash
   make index-data
   ```

1. **Verify API Endpoints**:
   - Check that the data is available via these API endpoints:
     - [Projects Endpoint](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/owasp/search/project)
     - [Issues Endpoint](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/owasp/search/issue)

### Optional Steps (for fetching GitHub OWASP organization data)

If you plan to fetch GitHub OWASP data locally, follow these additional steps:

1. **Create a Super User**:
   - Run the following command to create a super user for accessing the admin interface:

  ```bash
  make setup
  ```

1. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token**:
    - Create a GitHub [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

1. **Update Environment Variables with GitHub Token**:
    - Open `backend/.env/local` again and update it with your GitHub token:

      ```plaintext
      GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_token>
      ```

1. **Sync Local Database Data**:
   - Now you should be able to run the following command to sync your local database data with GitHub:

   ```bash
   make sync
   ```

### Troubleshooting Guide for Windows Users

This troubleshooting section is tailored for Windows users.

#### 1. Ensure WSL is Installed

The `make run` command requires WSL to function properly. Make sure WSL is installed and configured on your system. If you haven't installed WSL yet, follow [Microsoft's official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

#### 2. Ensure WSL integration is enabled in Docker Desktop settings

Check `Resources -- WSL integration` in Docker application settings.

#### 3. Install the `make` Command

When running the `make` command for the first time, you may be prompted to install the `make` tool. Run the following commands in your WSL terminal to install it:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
...
$ sudo apt install make
...
```

### Resolving Frontend Permission Issues

If you encounter permission issues while running the `make run` command, follow these steps:

1. Open a new terminal.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory by running:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This should resolve any permission-related issues and ensure the frontend dependencies are installed correctly

### Important Setup Instructions

1. **Running Make Commands**
   .

   ```bash
   make: *** No rule to make target 'run'.  Stop.
   ```

   Instruction:

   - Always run make commands from the project root directory

1. **Data File Setup**

   ```bash
   chmod: cannot access 'backend/data/nest.json.gz': No such file or directory
   ```

   Instruction:

   - Restore the missing file using git:

     ```bash
     git restore backend/data/nest.json.gz
     ```

1. **File Permissions Setup**

   ```bash
   Permission denied: '<file_name>'
   ```

   Instruction:

   - Add executable permissions to necessary files:

     ```bash
     chmod +x <file_name>
     ```

1. **Command Execution Order**
   - Required order:
     1. First terminal: `make run` (wait until it's fully started)
     1. Second terminal: `another_cmds`

### Important Notes

- Keep all terminals open while working.
- For Windows users: You must use WSL to avoid conflicts and ensure the scripts execute correctly.
