# Development Practices & Code Quality Guidelines

## Deep Analysis Before Implementation

### Thorough Examination Requirements
- **Model Analysis**: Study model fields and relationships before writing any code
- **Pattern Research**: Examine existing URL patterns and naming conventions in the codebase
- **Domain Understanding**: Understand domain-specific requirements (e.g., what belongs in sitemaps, search indexes, etc.)
- **Assumption Validation**: Question assumptions and optimize for the specific use case
- **Context Awareness**: Consider how new code fits within the existing OWASP Nest ecosystem

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
1. Review related models in `backend/apps/*/models/`
2. Check existing URL patterns in `backend/apps/*/urls.py`
3. Understand data relationships and foreign keys
4. Identify reusable patterns and conventions
5. Consider performance and scalability implications

## Code Quality Best Practices

### Data Handling
- **Query-Level Filtering**: Filter out unwanted data at the database query level rather than handling errors later
- **Proper Relationships**: Use appropriate field relationships (e.g., `organization.nest_key` vs `owner.login`)
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established patterns consistently (like `.lower()` for URLs)
- **Framework Optimization**: Remove arbitrary limits when framework handles pagination better
- **Error Prevention**: Design to prevent errors rather than catch them

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Maintain clear separation between static routes and dynamic content
- **URL Conflict Prevention**: Prevent URL conflicts through proper design
- **Specialized Classes**: Let specialized classes handle their own URL patterns and priorities
- **Focused Base Classes**: Keep base classes focused on truly shared functionality

## Superior Testing Approach

### Testing Philosophy
- **Behavior Over Implementation**: Test what methods return, not how they achieve it
- **Maintainable Tests**: Write tests that survive implementation changes
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Use realistic test scenarios over edge cases that can't occur
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Cover all important functionality (lastmod, priority, etc.)

### Testing Guidelines
- Focus on business logic and user-facing behavior
- Don't test error cases that are prevented by design
- Test integration points and data transformations
- Verify performance characteristics for critical paths
- Use Django's test framework effectively with fixtures and factories

## Architecture Principles

### System Design
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organize code by business domain (github, owasp, slack, ai)
- **API-First Approach**: Design APIs before implementing UI components
- **Microservice Boundaries**: Respect service boundaries in Docker architecture
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure data consistency across services and APIs

### Performance Considerations
- **Database Optimization**: Use select_related() and prefetch_related() appropriately
- **Caching Strategy**: Leverage Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Search Optimization**: Optimize Algolia indexing and search queries
- **Vector Operations**: Efficiently use pgvector for AI-related features

## Code Review Mindset

### Quality Questions
- **Optimization**: "Could this be done better?" before submitting
- **Performance**: Consider database queries, caching, and response times
- **SEO Impact**: Think about search engine optimization implications
- **User Experience**: Consider impact on frontend performance and usability
- **Maintainability**: Ensure code is readable and follows project conventions

### Review Checklist
1. **Consistency**: Does it follow existing patterns and conventions?
2. **Performance**: Are database queries optimized?
3. **Security**: Are there any security implications?
4. **Testing**: Is the functionality adequately tested?
5. **Documentation**: Is complex logic documented?
6. **Error Handling**: Are edge cases handled appropriately?

## OWASP Nest Specific Guidelines

### Django Best Practices
- Use Django's built-in features (admin, migrations, ORM) effectively
- Follow Django's security best practices
- Leverage django-configurations for environment management
- Use Django Ninja for REST APIs and Strawberry for GraphQL

### Frontend Integration
- Ensure backend APIs support frontend requirements
- Consider TypeScript type generation from backend schemas
- Optimize for Next.js SSR and client-side rendering
- Maintain consistency between REST and GraphQL APIs

### Data Management
- Respect the data sync workflows (update-data, enrich-data, index-data)
- Consider impact on Algolia search indexing
- Ensure compatibility with backup and restore processes
- Handle external API integrations (GitHub, Slack) gracefully
