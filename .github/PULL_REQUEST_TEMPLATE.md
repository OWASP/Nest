## STOP AND READ BEFORE SUBMITTING! REMOVE THIS PARAGRAPH BEFORE OPENING THE PR

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OWASP Nest!

Before starting any work, all external contributors **must first be assigned to an issue** in the repository.
This is a mandatory step in the OWASP Nest workflow and ensures that effort is coordinated, approved, and tracked properly.

**Exception:** OWASP leaders are not required to follow this rule —- just make sure your username is included in the [exception list](https://github.com/OWASP/Nest/blob/main/.github/workflows/check-pr-issue-skip-usernames.txt).

**If you were not assigned to the issue you are trying to resolve, stop right now and do NOT create this PR.**
Unassigned pull requests are automatically closed by our workflows — please don't waste your time.

If you want to be assigned on any available issue, comment on it and wait for confirmation from the maintainers or project leads.
