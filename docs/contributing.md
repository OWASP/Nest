# Contributing to Nest

!!! note "Thank You"
    Thank you for considering contributing to the **OWASP Nest** project! This document provides guidelines to help you get started.

## Project Overview

Nest is a full-stack web application built using:

* **Backend**: Python, Django
* **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS
* **Search**: Algolia

!!! info "Containerization"
    The project uses a **containerized approach** for both development and production environments. Docker is required to run Nest locally.

## Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed:

### Required Tools

1. **Docker**
    * Required for running the Nest instance
    * [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)

2. **pre-commit**
    * Required to automate code checks and apply fixes
    * Installation options:
        * Virtual environment: `pip install pre-commit`
        * OS package: `apt install pre-commit` / `brew install pre-commit`
        * Other methods depending on your configuration

### Windows Users Requirements

!!! warning "Windows Setup Requirements"
    **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** is required for Windows users to enable Linux compatibility.

    1. The `make run` command requires WSL
    2. You must use WSL terminal (not Windows PowerShell)
    3. WSL integration must be enabled in Docker Desktop settings

    === "WSL Installation"
        Follow [Microsoft's official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

    === "Docker Desktop Setup"
        1. Open Docker Desktop
        2. Go to Settings → Resources → WSL Integration
        3. Enable WSL integration

    !!! danger "PowerShell Not Supported"
        Do not report issues if using PowerShell for running commands -- it's not the intended way to run Nest locally.

## Getting Started

## Optional Setup

### GitHub Data Integration

To fetch GitHub OWASP data locally:

1. **Create Super User**
    ```bash
    make setup
    ```

2. **Configure GitHub Access**
    1. Create a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
    2. Add to `backend/.env`:
        ```plaintext
        GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token>
        ```

3. **Sync Data**
    ```bash
    make sync-data
    ```

### NestBot Development

!!! danger "Important Notice"
    Never install your development Slack application in the OWASP Slack workspace.
    This will interfere with OWASP Nest functionality and trigger unnecessary notifications.
    Always use a different workspace (create your own if needed).

1. **ngrok Setup**
    1. Create [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account
    2. Follow [installation instructions](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/#step-1-install)
    3. Create static domain at [ngrok domains](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains)
    4. Configure ngrok:
        ```bash
        ngrok config edit
        ```
        ```yaml
        agent:
            authtoken: <your-auth-token>
        tunnels:
            NestBot:
              addr: 8000
              proto: http
              hostname: <your-static-domain>
        ```
    5. Start ngrok:
        ```bash
        ngrok start NestBot
        ```

2. **Update NestBot Configuration**

    Add to `backend/.env`:
    ```plaintext
    DJANGO_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your-slack-bot-token>
    DJANGO_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=<your-slack-signing-secret>
    ```

3. **Configure Slack App**
    * Use [NestBot manifest file](https://github.com/OWASP/Nest/blob/main/backend/apps/slack/MANIFEST.yaml) (copy its contents and save it into `Features -- App Manifest`).
    * Replace slash commands endpoint with your ngrok domain
    * Reinstall your Slack application after making the changes using `Settings -- Install App` section

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

```bash
make check
#This command runs linters and other static analysis tools for both the frontend and backend.
```

!!! warning
    PRs failing code quality checks will not be reviewed.

### Testing

```bash
make test
#Our CI/CD pipelines automatically run tests against every Pull Request,
#You can run tests locally before submitting a PR.
```

!!! warning
    PRs failing tests will not be merged.

#### Test Coverage

* Minimum test coverage requirement for the Backend: [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/OWASP/Nest/blob/main/backend/pyproject.toml)
* Minimum test coverage requirement for the Frontend: [jest.config.ts](https://github.com/OWASP/Nest/blob/main/frontend/jest.config.ts)

!!! danger "Important Notice"
    - Ensure your changes do not drop the overall test coverage percentage.
    - If you are adding new functionality, include relevant test cases.

## Troubleshooting

### Resolving "Unexpected Character" Error During Application Execution or Docker Image Building

This error is usually caused by incorrect encoding of `.env` files. To resolve the issue, follow these steps:

## Steps to Fix the Encoding Issue

1. **Open the `.env` file in a text editor** (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. **Check and change the encoding**:
   - Click on the encoding information in the bottom-right corner of the VS Code window.
   - Select **"Save with Encoding"**.
   - Choose **"UTF-8"** from the list (ensure it's not "UTF-8 with BOM").
3. **Save the file** with the correct encoding.
4. **Restart the application** using the command
   **`make run`**.
